## Overview
This interactive dashboard comprehensively analyses traffic collisions across New York City. It is designed to help stakeholders—such as city planners, transportation officials, safety advocates, and the general public—better understand collision patterns, identify high-risk areas, and support data-driven decisions to enhance road safety. An addition  I would be editing.

## Raw Data
The raw data for this dashboard includes a comprehensive dataset of the NYC Road Accident dataset. It consists of the following fields:

1. **Collison ID**: A unique identifier for each collision record.
2. **Date**: The date on which the collision occurred.
3. **Time**: The specific time the collision happened.
4. **Borough**: The borough (e.g., Brooklyn, Queens, Bronx, etc.) where the collision occurred.
5. **Zip Code**: The zip code of the location where the accident took place.
6. **Latitude**: The latitude coordinate for the accident location.
7. **Longitude**: The longitude coordinate for the accident location.
8. **Street Name**: The primary street name where the accident occurred.
9. **Number of Persons Injured**: Total number of individuals injured in the accident.
10. **Number of Persons Killed**: Total number of individuals who died as a result of the accident.
11. **Number of Pedestrians Injured**: Number of injured individuals who were pedestrians.
12. **Number of Pedestrians Killed**: Number of pedestrians who died in the accident.
13. **Number of Cyclist Injured**: Number of injured individuals who were riding bicycles.
14. **Number of Cyclist Killed**: Number of cyclists who were killed.
15. **Number of Motorist Injured**: Number of motorists injured in the accident.
16. **Number of Motorist Killed**: Number of motorists who died in the accident.

### Data Cleaning Process in Power Query
- **Removed Duplicates**: Identified and removed duplicate rows based on Collision ID to ensure each collision record is unique.
- **Time Data Type**: Changed the time data type from Time & Date to Time only.
- **Null**: Changed the Null values in the Borough, Street Name and Contributing factor column to "Unknown or Unspecified".
- **Find and Replace**: Used the Find and Replace to reduce the contents of the "Vehicle" and "Contributing Factors" columns.

---

## Dashboard Features
- **Interactive Filters**: Users can slice and explore the data by borough, vehicle type, contributing factors, month, and injury/fatality type for flexible, in-depth analysis.
- **Visualizations**: The dashboard incorporates bar charts, pie charts, stacked columns, and heat maps to clearly display accident trends, contributing causes, and spatial distribution.
- **Custom Groupings**: Vehicle types and contributing factors were grouped into meaningful categories (e.g., Passenger, Commercial, Unknown) to simplify interpretation.
- **Time-Based Analysis**: Monthly and hourly trend graphs allow users to detect seasonal patterns and peak collision times.
- **Highlight Cards (KPIs)**: Summary cards show total collisions, injuries, and fatalities, providing an instant snapshot of the overall impact.
- **User-Centric Design**: Custom colour schemes, consistent font styles, and intuitive slicer layouts were applied to ensure clarity, readability, and visual appeal.
- **Responsive Insights**: All charts dynamically update based on selected filters, helping users draw targeted conclusions based on specific scenarios.

---

## Insights & Conclusions
1. **Leading Causes of Collisions**:
   - The top contributing factor to collisions is "Unspecified", meaning a lack of detailed reporting.
   - Driver inattention/distraction is the most reported cause, emphasizing the need for awareness campaigns on focused driving.
2. **Fatalities Across Boroughs**:
   - Brooklyn has the highest fatalities among pedestrians, motorists, and cyclists.
   - Motorists experience the most fatalities overall, suggesting that driver safety improvements are needed.
3. **Vehicle Types in Collisions**:
   - Passenger vehicles account for the highest number of collisions, far exceeding any other vehicle type across all boroughs.
   - Bicycles, taxis, motorcycles, and buses contribute to accidents but at significantly lower numbers compared to passenger vehicles.
   - Brooklyn leads in overall collisions, followed by Queens and the Bronx, possibly due to higher traffic density and population.

## Tools & Techniques Used
1. **Power BI**:
   - Power Query Editor for extensive data cleaning and transformation.
   - DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) to calculate key metrics like total collisions, injuries, fatalities, and percentage breakdowns.
   - Slicers for dynamic filtering by borough, vehicle type, month, and contributing factors.
   - Custom Visuals including bar charts, pie charts, stacked columns, KPIs, and heatmaps for clear insight presentation.
2. **Figma**: Designed visual mockups and layout guides to ensure a clean, user-friendly dashboard interface.

## Questions & Answers
### Q1: Compare the % of total accidents by month. Do you notice any seasonal patterns? 
**Ans**: Yes, a clear seasonal pattern emerges. The highest percentage of accidents occurred in October, followed by June and August. The months with the lowest accident rates were February and January.

### Q2: Break down accident frequency by day of week and hour of day. Based on this data, when do accidents occur most frequently?
**Ans**: - Accidents peak sharply around midnight (12:00 AM) — likely due to the timestamp default or batch reporting practices — followed by a steady increase from 6:00 AM, with consistent spikes between 8:00 AM to 6:00 PM, especially around 3:00 PM to 6:00 PM, coinciding with afternoon rush hours.
         - By Day of Week: Fridays have the highest accident frequency, followed closely by Thursdays and Wednesdays.
Weekends (especially Sundays) see fewer incidents, likely due to reduced commuting traffic.

### Q3:  On which particular street were the most accidents reported? What does that represent as a % of all reported accidents? 
**Ans**: The street with the most reported accidents was Brooklyn.

### Q4: What was the most common contributing factor for the accidents reported in this sample (based on 
Vehicle 1)? What about fatal accidents specifically?  
**Ans**: - The most common contributing factor across all accidents (based on Vehicle 1) was Unspecified.
         - For fatal accidents specifically, the leading contributing factor remained Unspecified.

## Recommendation
1. Enhance Driver Awareness & Distraction Prevention Campaigns: Implementing stricter penalties for distracted driving and conducting public awareness campaigns on focused driving and accident prevention.
2. Improve Traffic Control & Law Enforcement: Increase traffic patrols in high-collision areas and enforce speed limits, right-of-way laws, and lane discipline more strictly.
3. Develop Safer Infrastructure for Cyclists & Pedestrians: Expand dedicated bike lanes and pedestrian-friendly zones and install more traffic calming measures (e.g., speed bumps, pedestrian islands).
4. Targeted Safety Measures in High-Collision Boroughs: Brooklyn & Queens: Implement city-wide road safety programs due to high fatalities.
